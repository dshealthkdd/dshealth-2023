CALL FOR PAPERS

4 page submissions due by ~~May 23th, 2023~~ Jun 15, 2023

Generative models have a long history and there are many application areas in
medical machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). With the
development in deep neural networks, researchers focused on Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and
autoregressive models in the past years. More recently, very large deep
generative models have gained popularity, including the large language models
(LLMs) such as Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) and text-to-image
diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion. In healthcare research, one of the
most common applications of generative models has been the generation of
synthetic data for training of machine learning models. It is often used to
increase representation of patient subgroups to improve generalization and
mitigate algorithmic biases. This is especially valuable in application domains
where data is hard to come by. The generative models can also be used for
specific model evaluation purposes (e.g., within a robustness or
generalizability assessment; virtual clinical trials). They can help to
generate synthetic ground truth data when labeling of data is extremely
burdensome. Moreover, generative models have been successfully applied in data
preprocessing or enhancement, such as image reconstruction or denoising deep
learning algorithms in the medical imaging space. While such generative models
have proven their utility in the health domain, many open questions remain with
regard to the approaches for evaluation of their effectiveness and safety.
Testing and evaluation of such models require specific considerations. Taking
the assessment of the gap between the generated data and the reality — so
called Sim2Real challenge — as an example, it is often unclear how to (i)
quantify this domain gap and its impact on downstream performance in a
meaningful manner and (ii) reduce it in order to fully leverage the potential
of generative models. New challenges are also emerging on a more grand scale.
The recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) makes the generation of
data even more effortless. However, the misinformation that is generated with
such models may cause a “pollution” of data for future model training. We can
expect an increased need for effective fact checking approaches. Despite the
huge growth of this area of research, the actual use of NLP technology for fact
checking is still in its infancy. In this half-day workshop we would like to
discuss some of the most common applications of generative models in the ML/AI
research in the healthcare domain, the current challenges and also explore what
are the potential new areas of application
